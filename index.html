            <h2>Welcome to Off the Grid Living</h2>
            <p>So, you want to know how to live off the grid. It’s simple, really. Move to the woods, build a cabin, throw on some solar panels and a wind turbine for power, and drill a well. Then start raising chickens, cows, and pigs, start a garden, and sit on your front porch while sipping coffee and staring out at the beautiful natural wilderness around you. Easy, right? Not exactly.

                It takes planning, preparation, and work to move off grid. And once you’re there, the work will continue with the maintenance and upkeep of your homestead.</p>
